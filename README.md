# Parse Angular Patch

Brought to you by the [BRANDiD](https://www.getbrandid.com) team

  - Seamless Parse integration with AngularJS, using promises ($q)
  - Never worry about $scope digests again
  - Additional (and optional) module to enhance Parse Objects and Collections


## Install

### Option 1

Install via Bower: 

```bash
bower install parse-angular-patch
```

### Option 2

Grab the latest version of the patch: [parse-angular.min.js](https://raw2.github.com/brandid/parse-angular-patch/master/dist/parse-angular.min.js)



##How to use

Include the module in your project:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['ngAnimate', 'parse-angular'])
```

That's it. How hard was that?! You can now do ANYWHERE in your angular app things such as:

```javascript
// Queries
var query = new Parse.Query("Monsters");
query.equalTo("name", "Frankeistein");
query.first()
.then(function(result){
        $scope.monsters = result;
});
// Cloud Code is patched too!
Parse.Cloud.run("myCloudCodeFunction", function(results) {
    $scope.data = results;
});
```

And your scope will always be updated.
